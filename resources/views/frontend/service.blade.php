                    The design premise behind EcoCamp was to create accommodation where travellers could connect with nature and explore Torres del Paine without leaving a footprint. Engineers designed the structures to rely mostly on green energy and EcoCamp has been certified as an ISO14001 property. All electricity comes from a micro-hydro turbine and photovoltaic panels. Skylights in the domes allow for natural light to shine through during the day, saving on lighting and heating costs, and a view to the stars at night. Eco Camp also supports the local community. Produce, meat and poultry are bought from local farmers. 90% of their staff is from the region, mostly from neighboring Puerto Natales. Furthermore, they donate every year to the Torres del Paine Legacy fund, which helps protect the environment, improve the community and strengthen tourism products of the region. There are four dome possibilities: Standard, Superior, Suites, and Suites with lofts. Starting with superior rooms, domes feature ensuite facilities, heating (propane or wood) and charging capabilities for laptop and camera.
